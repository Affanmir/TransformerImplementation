**PyTorch Transformer**

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Transformer model in PyTorch. The code is written from scratch and can be used for educational purposes or as a starting point for building more complex transformer-based models.

**Dependencies**

To use this code, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

    PyTorch
    NumPy

You can install these dependencies using pip:

    pip install torch numpy

**Usage**

The main component of the transformer code is the MultiHeadAttention module, which can be used as a building block for more complex models. To use the MultiHeadAttention module in your code, you can simply import it from the transformer.py file:

    
    
    from transformer import MultiHeadAttention
    
  

  The MultiHeadAttention module can then be instantiated and used in your code:
    
   
    
    attn = MultiHeadAttention(d_model=512, num_heads=8)
    output = attn(input_tensor)

You can adjust the d_model and num_heads parameters to match the size of your input tensor and the number of attention heads you want to use.

**Example**

To run a simple example of the transformer code, you can use the example.py script provided in this repository. This script generates a random input tensor and applies the MultiHeadAttention module to it:

python

import torch
from transformer import MultiHeadAttention

# Generate random input tensor
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 10, 512)

# Instantiate MultiHeadAttention module
attn = MultiHeadAttention(d_model=512, num_heads=8)

# Apply attention to input tensor
output_tensor = attn(input_tensor)

print(output_tensor.shape)

This will output the shape of the output tensor, which should be (32, 10, 512).
